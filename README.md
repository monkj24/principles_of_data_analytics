# Principles of Data Analytics

by Joanna Mnich

# 1. Introduction

The Principles of Data Analytics overview of how data can be converted into valuable knowledge. 
It covers fundamental concepts such as data collection, cleansing, visualization, and interpretation.
The project investigates statistical approaches, data collection methods, and fundamental machine learning algorithms for extracting useful information from data. 


# 2. Iris Data

The Iris dataset was used as a foundational example to apply core data analytics techniques, such as data visualization
statistical analysis and classification.
We applied supervised learning methods, such as logistic regression and decision trees, to classify iris species based on sepal and petal dimensions.
Pairplots and boxplots were used to visually examine relationships between flower measurements and species, helping to identify patterns and correlations.
Using the Iris dataset allowed us to implement the full data analysis workflowâ€”from data exploration and visualization to model building and evaluation.

The simplicity and structure of the Iris dataset made it an ideal starting point for understanding fundamental principles in data analytics.
